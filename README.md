# Fireworks
A simple firework simulation made in four hours.

# Why isn't the classes on separate files?
I don't know, I made it in four hours, on my phone.

# It works on any device?
It works on any device that has Python 3.10 or greater.
At least, I think it works, I don't know,
I made it right now and only tested on my phone.

# What about the screen resolution?
Probably a weird fullscreen, I made it on my phone,
so, for me, it doesn't matter, since I'm stuck on fullscreen
